Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run `python -m Shapes.data_generation` to generate shape data.

The shape generation method has 5 available shapes (square, triangle, circle, ellipse, and rectangle), 5 colors (blue, green, yellow, purple, and red), 5 sizes, and 5 angles of orientation (optional). You can choose the number of categories (shapes) you use. It will then assign each shape one of the colors, sizes, and angles (optional) and samples canonical examples from a normal distribution centered at the value assigned it.

Non canonical samples are generated by independently choosing different color, size, or angle for a given shape, and then sampling a shape from that distribution, or by choosing all of the stats of some other shape and then sampling from that distribution. You can change the defaul image size in Shapes/drawing.py
